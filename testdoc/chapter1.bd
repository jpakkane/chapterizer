# The Fake Chapter

This /is some/ text to fill up a dummy paragraph of text. A code
sample with brackets: `#include<foobar>`.

```code
We are the Borg.
Resistance is futile.
You will be assimilated.
```

|The fifth cylinder| must t*hi*s *bol*d *Woking*.

After this paragraph there will be a scene change. The visual
appearance should be such that there is an empty line and the next
paragraph is not indented.

#s

This is the paragraph that should not be indented. Some more text here
to make sure it takes more than one line in the final output.

This paragraph should again be indented. Some math: /a/^2^ + /b/^2^ = /c/⁴


```footnote
This is a footnote with some text in it. You can't yet name them or refer
to them, but then again why would you.
```

“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”

I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a
little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I
did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the
shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two
luminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey
snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the
writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another.
