# The Fake Chapter with Such a Long Name That It Requires Multiple Lines

This /is some/ text to fill up a dummy paragraph of text. A code
sample with brackets: `#include<foobar>`.

```code
We are the Borg.
Resistance is futile.
You will be assimilated.

Empty line above.
```

|The fifth cylinder| must t*hi*s *bol*d *Woking*.

Escaping characters in output text: \c{/} slash, \c{*} asterisk, \c{|}
pipe, \c{`} backtick, \c{#} hash, \c{\} backslash, \c{^} circumflex.
All in one word: \c{/*|`#\^}. Lastly a word with multiple
replacements: ping\c{/}pong\c{*}pung.

After this paragraph there will be a scene change. The visual
appearance should be such that there is an empty line and the next
paragraph is not indented.

#s

This is the paragraph that should not be indented. Some more text here
to make sure it takes more than one line in the final output.

This paragraph should again be indented. Some math: /a/·2 + /b/·2 =
/c/⁴


```footnote
This is a footnote with some text in it. You can't yet name them or refer
to them, but then again why would you.
```

“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”

I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a
little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I
did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the
shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two
luminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey
snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the
writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another.

A letter follows:

```letter
This is an inline piece of text that represents a letter, telegram,
large piece of quotation or something similar.

For test purposes there are now some more paragraphs of text. This is a
slightly longer paragraph than the previous one. It turns out that
writing filler text is a lot more work than one would imagine.

And finally here is a short paragraph to end it all.
